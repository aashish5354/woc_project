# Project Name: ML Bootcamp
This project aims to implement various machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. The algorithms that are implemented in this project include:
1. Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Logistic Regression
4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
5. N-layer Neural Networks

All of these algorithms have been implemented without the use of any external libraries, except for NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib which are used for numerical computations and graphs.


# Dependencies
1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib

This project was made on Google Colaboratory running Python 3.9.16
